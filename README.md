## 🌟 Project Overview
CareerPath is not just a static information site; it's an **interactive dashboard**. It solves the problem of "tutorial hell" by providing structured Roadmaps, Salary Insights, and Resource Aggregation for over 10 different technology stacks (MERN, VLSI, Python, etc.).

## ✨ Key Features (Technical Highlights)

### 🎨 Exclusive UI/UX
-   **Glassmorphism Design**: Modern, semi-transparent frosted glass aesthetic using advanced CSS (`backdrop-filter`).
-   **Dynamic Animations**: Smooth transitions, hover effects, and entrance animations.
-   **Responsive Grid**: Fully adaptive layout for mobile and desktop.

### 🧠 Smart Features
-   **🤖 AI Career Bot**: An integrated chatbot simulation that parses natural language to provide curated resources and advice.
-   **⚡ Instant Search**: Real-time filtering algorithm to find technology paths instantly.
-   **❤️ Personalization**: ability to "Favorite" career paths to build a custom wishlist (Local State Management).

### 🛡️ Secure Architecture
-   **Protected Routes**: Higher-Order Components (HOC) pattern used to secure detail pages behind an authentication wall.
-   **Authentication Flow**: Custom Signup/Login logic with validation and error handling.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
-   **Frontend**: React.js (Functional Components, Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`).
-   **Routing**: React Router v6 (`Routes`, `Route`, `Navigate`, `nested routes`).
-   **Styling**: Pure CSS3 with Variables and Flexbox/Grid (No CSS frameworks used, demonstrating core CSS mastery).
-   **Icons**: React-Icons & Unicode implementation.
